# Write_ReadFile
This is a program that allows the user to create a text file called "numbers.txt" (if the file is not present already) and enter/read numbers
into said text file. 
The user is prompted to enter five numbers so that it may calculate an average of those numbers.
The average is displayed along with the amount of numbers there were within the file.
